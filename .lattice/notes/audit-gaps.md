# Sitewide audit gaps register

Append-only register of typography and color elements that did not fit any
canonical utility/token during per-page audits under FRAC-18. Each entry
represents a system-gap surfaced by an Audit sub-agent and migrated to a
nearest-fit utility/token in the corresponding Apply PR.

This register exists so the gaps accumulate sitewide and can be reviewed in
one batch by a human. Do NOT edit existing entries. Do NOT invent tiers or
tokens here. The register is a human-decision queue, not a system change.

## Entry format

<!--
- file:line — <element description>
  Nearest-fit chosen: <utility or token>
  Why it didn't fit: <one line>
  Proposed system change: <one line>
  Page: <page slug>
  Date: YYYY-MM-DD
-->

## Gaps

<!-- entries appended here by per-page audit sub-agents, in chronological order -->
